# Benny's Portfolio (Redesigned)

A modern, high-performance portfolio website built with **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🎨 Design System: Neon Aurora

This project features a custom design system focused on dark mode aesthetics, glassmorphism, and performance.

### Key Features
- **Zero Dependencies**: No Bootstrap, No jQuery, No Frameworks. Just pure, fast web technologies.
- **Glassmorphism**: Premium frosted glass effects using `backdrop-filter` and multilayered shadows.
- **Fluid Typography**: Text scales smoothly across all devices using CSS `clamp()`.
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover lifts, button shine effects, and smooth scroll animations.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Animated aurora blobs that move gently behind the content.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Custom Properties (Variables), Grid, Flexbox, Animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: `IntersectionObserver` for animations, `async/await` for API simulation.

## 📂 Structure

- `css/variables.css`: The heart of the design system (Colors, Spacing, Typography).
- `css/components.css`: Reusable UI elements (Buttons, Cards, Badges).
- `css/sections.css`: Layouts for specific page sections (Hero, Nav, Grid).
- `js/script.js`: Lightweight logic for mobile menu and animations.

## 🚀 How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build step required!
